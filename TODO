    * check that I'm actually recording states
    * add a scoreboard
    ** refactor much of Board functionality to algorithms.py
    ** add validation functions to classes
    *** add __repr__
    *** overwride __eq__
    *** fix bug where it thinks a move is invalid if a stone is surrounded by its
        own allies
    *** fix non-capture bug
    * refactor many functions to not have such sloppy objet access
    *** if move is suicidal, check to see if it captures anything
    * implement undo
    ** implement pass
    * save games played with scores for learning and reloading

    DONE:
        Make grid draw, selector draw, stones draw
        check for state validity
        add a logger
        add pass to move options
