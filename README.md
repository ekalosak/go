# go
the game of go

If you've got the dependencies, just type:
    
    python play_in_terminal.py

In this directory, you'll find:

1. `play_in_terminal.py`   play go in the terminal! self contained mostly
2. `app.py`                pygame gui for Go, depricated
3. `utils.py`              logging, i/o, etc. backend stuff
4. `tests.py`              unit tests for game logic
